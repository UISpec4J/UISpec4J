  Using the Java Color class for specifying colors can be too tedious for testing purposes.
  When writing a test that checks that a given table cell is red, we do not always want to
  specify the exact color (#FF0000 in RGB), we just want to say "red" and have our test run
  even if the color chosen by the developers is #DD1111.
</p>

<p>
  To this end, UISpec4J proposes three different means for checking a color:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use a "user-friendly" color name</strong> such as "red" or "blue". In this case
    the tool will check that the color is a shade of red or blue.
    The authorized names are those of the predefined Color objects defined in the Java
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">Color</a> class.</li>
  <li><strong>Use a specific color value</strong> such as "FF0021". In this case the tool will check the
    exact color.</li>
  <li><strong>Use a Color object</strong> such as Color.red or a custom made Color. This is especially
    useful in Unit tests, when we want to use a static Color instance used both by the
    production code and the test. In this case the tool will also check the exact color.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is why all color-related methods such as Table.backgroundEquals use Object
  arguments - you can provide them either String or Color objects.
</p>
<p>
  Behind the scenes, UISpec4J basically computes a distance between expected and actual colors
  by converting them in the HSB (Hue/Saturation/Brightness) color space. Results may not always
  be accurate since colors can be subject to one's judgement, but in such cases you can always
  stick to more formal definitions - although as a result your tests will be more sensible to
  little cosmetic changes.
